The ABI for the ARM Architecture
specifies a standard format for
exception unwind information. This
information is used when an exception is
thrown to determine where control should
be transferred. In particular, the
unwind information is used to determine
which function called the function that
threw the exception, and which function
called that one, and so forth. This
information is also used to restore the
values of callee-saved registers in the
function catching the exception.
